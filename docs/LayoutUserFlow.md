# Layout and User Flow for the Revamped Specialty Product Category Page

## Reference
For inspiration, please refer to our [Category Inspiration document](docs/CategoryInspiration.md).

## Overview
The page is designed to deliver a continuous scrolling experience with dynamic, interactive sections. The user experience is broken down into three key sections:

### Section 1: Hero Section
- **Layout:** Two-column layout.
  - **Left Column:** 
    - Contains a Header Title and Subtitle describing the category.
    - Emphasize strong, engaging typography.
  - **Right Column:**
    - Features a horizontal scrolling carousel.
    - Displays products in a 3-column, 1-row auto-scroller.
- **Design Notes:**
  - Draw inspiration from the Framer Product Hub example for a sleek dark mode styling.
  - Ensure smooth scroll animations and a clear call to action.

### Section 2: Main Content Section
- **Layout:** Grid layout that may vary between 2 to 3 columns.
  - Each grid item (Category Card) displays:
    - A background image.
    - Overlay text with the category name.
    - Subtle hover animations indicating interactivity.
- **Design Notes:**
  - The grid layout should smoothly transition as the user scrolls.
  - Consider incorporating parallax or fade-in scroll effects for depth.

### Section 3: Dynamic Reveal Section
- **Layout:** A section where additional content (or related products) is revealed via scroll-triggered animations.
- **Design Notes:**
  - Replace static sections such as "more like this" with dynamic scroll animations.
  - Ensure animations are smooth and performance-minded using frameworks like Framer Motion.

## User Flow
1. **Initial Load:**
   - The user is greeted with the Hero Section that immediately communicates the category's value through compelling headers and a dynamic product carousel.
2. **Scrolling Interaction:**
   - As the user scrolls down, the Main Content Section is revealed with a grid of category cards.
   - Smooth parallax or fade-in effects draw the user's focus to each new section.
3. **Engagement:**
   - Hovering over a category card triggers subtle animations, indicating that the card is clickable.
   - Clicking a card opens a detailed modal/pop-up (to be implemented in later steps) for expanded product information.
4. **Navigation:**
   - A sticky navigation or scroll indicator may appear as the user scrolls, offering quick jumps between sections.

## Responsiveness & Accessibility
- The two-column Hero Section should adapt to stack vertically on smaller devices.
- Grid layouts for category cards will reflow appropriately on mobile screens.
- All interactive elements will include keyboard navigation support and appropriate ARIA labels for accessibility.

## Testing Considerations
- **Manual Testing:** Verify layout consistency and interactions on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Automated Testing:** Create unit tests for UI components and integration tests for scroll animations and modal functionality.
- **Performance:** Use browser developer tools to monitor smoothness of scroll animations and overall page responsiveness.
